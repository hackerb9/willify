[George F. Will](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/george-f-will/) is known for high-falutin words. | Here's an actual example of his writing from an editorial he wrote in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-the-freedom-caucus-stands-for/2017/04/12/7477a632-1ee8-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html):

![George F. Will's Head](README.md.d/bigwill.png) | *With a mellifluous name suggesting bucolic tranquility, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is an unlikely object of the caterwauling recently directed at him and the House Freedom Caucus he leads. The vituperation was occasioned by the HFCâ€™s role rescuing Republicans from embracing an unpopular first draft of legislation to replace Obamacare.*

Is he a human thesaurus or does he use a program like this? :-)


## Usage

    ./willify.py filename.txt

## Requirements

You'll need python dictclient: `apt-get install python-dictclient`.

## Example

Original | Willified
---------|----------
*Come down, Dick.*                | Enter downward, Private eye.
*Come and see.*                   | Move along and back.
*See the big, big mother.*        | Inspect the great, excellent agent.
*See the funny little baby.*      | Come to the jocose exiguous nestling.
*Puff is my baby.*                | Flatulency is my preemie.
*Puff is my funny little baby.*   | Inhale is my fishy constricted mewling infant.
*I see the big mother.*           | I establish the cloyed fuss.
*I see the little baby.*          | I consider the immaterial honey.
*Look Jane.*                      | Spot Jane.
*See the big father.*             | Find out the exalted something.



## Optional

If you don't want to connect to dict.org, you can run dictd on your
own machine. This is pretty simple: `apt-get install dictd dict-wn
dict-moby-thesaurus`. Then change this line:

    dictd = dictclient.Connection('dict.org')

to

    dictd = dictclient.Connection()

## BUGS

None! Those are features!

## FUTURE 

Well, since this is just a joke, I'm probably not going to actually do
anything better with this, but the next logical steps would be:

1. Use word frequency charts to pick the least common synonym and
   replace it directly in the text instead of offering a ton of
   synonyms. (Alternately, use the most common word).

2. Output a web page that shows the text, but allows one to click on
   any word to select a synonym.

3. Read from a URL, so this can act as a filter.
